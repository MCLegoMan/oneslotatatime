## FAQ
- **Can I use this in a modpack or video?**
    - Ofcourse, if you're showing off the mod itself, such as a showcase or speedrun, I'd appriciate a link in the description!
- **Will this mod be ported to x.x.x?**
    - I am unlikely to port to specific versions, but as this mod was made for fun, however you can still ask. Other developers are free to port this mod, as long as they adhere to the conditions of the LGPL-3.0-or-later license.
- **I've got an idea for a werid mod!**
    - That's great! I highly suggest trying to make your own mods, the chaos you can cause can be AWESOME. That being said, I'm always up for a challenge, so feel free to reach out with your wacky ideas and I *might* just attempt it!
